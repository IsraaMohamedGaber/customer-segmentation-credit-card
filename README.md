# Customer Segmentation for Credit Card Customers

## Project Overview
This project performs customer segmentation on credit card customer data using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their spending habits, payment behaviors, and credit usage patterns to enable targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset (`CC GENERAL.csv`) contains 8950 records with 18 features including:
- Customer balance
- Purchase frequency
- Cash advance frequency
- Credit limit
- Payment patterns
- Tenure

## Key Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of dataset structure and features
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering
   - Data normalization
3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - K-means clustering
   - Evaluation of optimal cluster count
   - Cluster analysis and interpretation
4. **Visualization**:
   - Cluster distribution plots
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Behavioral pattern visualizations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`

## Results
The analysis identifies X distinct customer segments with unique behavioral patterns, enabling targeted marketing strategies for each group.
